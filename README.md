### Brief Explanation
`index.html` is the main page. It only contains an input box. It also includes the javascript library files.

`index.js` is the main Javascript file to use this jQuery autocomplete library to implement autocomplete search: https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete

`HeroSuggestion.java` is a Java servlet searches superhero names and return suggestions in JSON format.
